# Cosmological Simulation Mocks Campaign Configuration
# S0 Campaign: Multi-cosmology simulations for July 1, 2025 deadline

name: "cosmosim-mocks-2025"
description: |
  Multi-cosmology simulation campaign with LCDM, wCDM, and phiCDM models.
  Critical deadline: 2 production runs must be submitted by July 1, 2025.
  This campaign supports flagship cosmological mock generation for
  upcoming surveys and cosmological parameter inference studies.
